fir 1) loops: for (iterate over a sequence e.g,: list, set, tuple, string), while

for i in range(5): --> range index starts from 0.  range(2, number) means 2 to that number.
    print('something')

counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print('something')
    count += 1


 break, continue.

 2) Super example that python can go and iterate over a matrix:
    matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

for row in matrix:  # we can say matrix is a list of lists
    for element in row:
        print(element)
        print(element, end= ' ') # By default print will have a new line after a line. But if you want to add a space or custom behaviour you can use the end attibute.
    print()

 3) Functions in geenral. But if those functions in clasess, then we call them as methods.
     arguments vs parameters --> in the functin def name, it is paramteter. arguments are which we pass to function when we are calling them.

     default value in function example:

      def mydata(data, second=2): # second is having the default value so we can say it is an optinal parameter. Also, you need to add first required parameters followed by the optional parameters
        print("I am doing this"+data)
      mydata("jo")
 4) Lists: Ordered, mutable collection of items. // Go throughh the list methods from python documentation.
     Basic operations:
        Accessing elements : list[index]
        Slicing: list[start:end:step] # start is included, but end is excluded. Also check how negative index work in slicing.
        modifying elements: list[index] = new_value
        Adding elements: list.append(item)
        Removing elements: list.remove(item) #This is the value, If you multipe 3's, then it will remove the first 3
                           del list[index]

        List Comprehensions:
           if you have a list, to iterate, you can say:
           for item in first_lsit:
            print(item)

            OR

            for item in range(len(first)list)):
                print(first_list[i]

              OR i want to create a list, that will match a condition.

              new_list = [x for x in second_list if x%2==0] # Go a bit in-depth of this one.


      Important Example for substring:
        haystack = "sadbutsad"
        needle = "sad"
        Now you want to find the first occurence of sad, and print the index of s.
        for i in range(len(haystack)):
            if(haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle:
               print(i)
               break
