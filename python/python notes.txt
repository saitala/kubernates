fir 1) loops: for (iterate over a sequence e.g,: list, tuple, string), while

for i in range(5): --> range index starts from 0.  range(2, number) means 2 to that number.
    print('something')

counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print('something')
    count += 1


 break, continue.

 2) Super example that python can go and iterate over a matrix:
    matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

for row in matrix:  # we can say matrix is a list of lists
    for element in row:
        print(element)
        print(element, end= ' ') # By default print will have a new line after a line. But if you want to add a space or custom behaviour you can use the end attibute.
    print()

 3) Functions in geenral. But if those functions in clasess, then we call them as methods.
     arguments vs parameters --> in the functin def name, it is paramteter. arguments are which we pass to function when we are calling them.
